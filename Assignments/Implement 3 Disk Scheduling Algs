# Assignment: Implement 3 Disk Scheduling Algorithms (zybook 11.12)
# Description: This program simulates the operation of 3 disk scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SCAN, C-SCAN
# on a disk drive with 5,000 cylinders (0-4,999) and generates a random sequence of 1,000 cylinder requests
# and services them according to each of the three algorithms.
# Then reports the total amount of head movement required by each algorithm.

import random

# Constants
numCylinders = 5000
numRequests = 1000

# Generate 1,000 cylinder requests
requests = [random.randint(0, numCylinders - 1) for _ in range(numRequests)]


# FCFS Disk Scheduling Algorithm
def fcfs(requests, start):
    headMovement = abs(start - requests[0])

    for i in range(1, len(requests)):
        headMovement += abs(requests[i] - requests[i - 1])
    return headMovement


# SCAN Disk Scheduling Algorithm
def scan(requests, start):
    headMovement = 0
    sortedRequests = sorted(requests)
    left = [request for request in sortedRequests if request < start]
    right = [request for request in sortedRequests if request >= start]

    # Move right then left
    if right:
        headMovement += abs(start - right[0]) + abs(right[-1] - right[0])
    if left:
        headMovement += abs(right[-1] if right else start - left[-1])

    return headMovement


# C-SCAN Disk Scheduling Algorithm
def cScan(requests, start):
    headMovement = 0
    sortedRequests = sorted(requests)
    right = [request for request in sortedRequests if request >= start]
    left = [request for request in sortedRequests if request < start]

    # Move right to end, jump to beginning, go to rightmost of left
    if right:
        headMovement += abs(start - right[0]) + abs(numCylinders - 1 - right[0])
    if left:
        headMovement += abs(numCylinders - 1 - 0) + abs(0 - left[-1])

    return headMovement


# Initial position of disk head
initialPosition = 1234

# Apply each algorithm
fcfsMovement = fcfs(requests, initialPosition)
scanMovement = scan(requests, initialPosition)
cScanMovement = cScan(requests, initialPosition)

# print total amount of head movement
print("Total Head Movement")
print("FCFS:   ", fcfsMovement)
print("SCAN:   ", scanMovement)
print("C-SCAN: ", cScanMovement)
